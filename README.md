# Frontend coding challenge



### Task
Create a single page application that enables the user to search for GitHub repositories and displays the
results of the search. Each result item should display at least:

- repository name
- owner's avatar
- quality score
- used languages


Quality score is an abstract number representing the quality of the repository. Use data from the response
(e.g. number of stars, number of issues, number of contributors etc.) in order to calculate the score. How to
calculate it is up to you, be creative! Add a short comment in a documentation file to explain your formula.
Once a repository card is clicked present a new view with the owners account information. It should include:


- owner's avatar
- owner's name
- number of followers (optional, do not present it if number of followers is zero)
- owner's bio


### Conditions

Based on react or lit-html it‘s up to you which further tools and libraries you like to work with
